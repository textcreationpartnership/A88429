            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon the 11th. wee had newes, that the enemy was intrenching at a place called <hi>Soughing</hi> Towne, ≈øome 6. Miles ≈øouth of our City, and ≈øome 2000. Foot, and 200. Hor≈øe went out again≈øt them; The Lord <hi>Lambart</hi> commanding in chiefe; A ≈ømall battell they had, but the Enemy ≈øtood not, on the Enemies ≈øide ≈øome 70 or more was killed, and but one hurt on our ≈øide, and ≈øo came home that night, and brought home one of the Rebells Captaines and two more of the enemies Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ≈ølaine, many Letters of trea≈øon were found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him that was taken.</p>
            <p>On the 13. a man was brought to our City being taken by ≈øome of our ≈øcattering men ≈øcouting about our City, who confe≈øt without con≈øtraint, that he had killed an <hi>Engli≈øhwoman</hi> at a place called <hi>Le≈ølipe≈øom,</hi> 6.

            <p>Upon the 21. Wee had knowledge that our Ships ≈øent with vittaile to relieve <hi>Tredath</hi> had got ≈øafely in, and in ≈øpight of the enemy, who had chayned up the harbour, but our men brake the Chaine, and got in, notwith≈øtanding. And publike thankes was with us for that happine≈ø≈øe, for in ≈øuch a great ≈øtrait was that City, as to eat Hor≈øe fle≈øh, as letters from my friends from the City to mee te≈øtified; Al≈øo Captaine <hi>Bartlet</hi> who was the Sea Captaine, in his comming home met with ≈øome fore ≈ømall Boats or Barkes of the <hi>Wexford</hi> men, going toward the enemy in the North to carry Lenten provi≈øion, but hee ≈øpoyled their de≈øigne in ≈øinking mo≈øt or all of them, About the ≈øame time we had al≈øo Letters out of <hi>Mun≈øter,</hi> that all that part of the Countrey was ro≈øe in Rebellion being carried out by the Lord <hi>Mu≈øcry,</hi> and Lord <hi>Roch,</hi> who had profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed much fidellity, and many deceitfull promi≈øes had pa≈øt to the pre≈øident of that Province, till they ≈øaw their owne advantage, And it is reported they are not le≈ø≈øe then 20000 ≈øtrong, be≈øt appointed of all the Rebels, for indeed this Lord <hi>Mu≈øcry</hi> is the mo≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied man, of all the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Lords, So that now not one place in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but is in Rebellion, for the Lord of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> ≈øtands as ≈øome thinke Neuter, does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, or cannot do any thing, or will not, But wee heare that our Pre≈øident of <hi>Mun≈øter</hi> was forced to betake him≈øelfe to the ≈øtrong hold of <hi>Corke,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Corke</hi> betooke him≈øelfe to <hi>Yoyhall,</hi> which are
